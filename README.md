# Figma Clone to HTML Responsive Conversion

This project focuses on converting a Figma design into HTML with responsiveness for various devices. It serves as a platform for testing HTML markup, CSS skills, and responsive design techniques. Throughout this project, I have acquired valuable experience in several areas, including:

- **HTML Clean Markup:** Emphasizing clean and semantic HTML structure.
- **CSS Box Model:** Understanding and effectively utilizing the CSS box model for layout and design.
- **CSS Positioning:** Implementing different positioning techniques to achieve desired layout effects.
- **Grid Layout:** Leveraging CSS grid layout for flexible and efficient page structure.
- **Media Queries:** Employing media queries to adjust styles based on different viewport sizes.
- **Device Variants:** Ensuring compatibility and optimal display across various devices.

## Responsive Design Approach

In planning the responsive design for this project, I adopted a mobile-first approach. This approach involves writing code primarily for mobile devices, then progressively enhancing it for larger screens. The process typically follows this sequence: mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop. To achieve responsiveness, I utilized `min-width` breakpoints for defining styles tailored to different device sizes.

## Project Structure

- **`/assets`:** Contains assets such as images and icons used in the project.
- **`/styles`:** Stores CSS files responsible for styling the HTML markup.
- **`/index.html`:** The main HTML file representing the converted Figma design.
- **`/js`:** Stores JavaScript files for creating interectivity to the Elements.
